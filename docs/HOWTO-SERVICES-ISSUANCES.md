_HOWTO ISSUE SERVICES_

In this documentation file, I suggest how-to offer services through modifications of this web-kit.  In this example,
I will be using Game Store Inc., who is looking to create a tournament registration system for their Card Game events
that are hosted nearly every day of the week.  The owner and managers would like for their regulars to be able to 
purchase coupons online and redeem them in store or before they leave their home for an event in private.

For this tournament system, Game Store Inc. is hosting Magic The Gathering tournaments regularly.  The owner wishes that
his customers can register for Friday Night Magic, Draft, Vintage, Modern, and Legacy tournaments by purchasing their 
admissions before they arrive in-store.  The owner creates two Ripple accounts, one of the accounts trusts the other
for the following currency codes:FNM, DFT, VIN, MDN, and LGY which stand for the aforementioned tournament types.

The owner then accesses the Gateway account and issues a number of the total capacity of seats for each of these events
for the week to the hot-wallet which trusted the Gateway.  The hot-wallet then sells these admissions for XRP, Bitcoin,
or any other preferred asset from a Gateway.  The owner wants to give away XRP from the Gateway account to his clients,
so he creates a page/thread on his pre-existing website/forum for his clients to gather the give-away information.
The customers then trust the Game Store Inc. Issuaning address by following the instructions found at the tournament
system web site, fund their Ripple wallet, and then purchase their admission(s) from the Game Store's hot-wallet.  

The owner wants to track how these IOUs are redeemed, so he requires that his customers send the IOU for admission to
the tournament with a Destination Tag; the owner decides that this should be the DCI# which is used for registering for
tournaments such as these.  When the owner goes to fetch accounting information from his Ripple accounts, s/he tracks 
which  DCI#/Ripple address pair sent the IOUs to the Gateway to register and matches this data to the sale for the IOUs 
offered to the market from the hot-wallet account's history.
